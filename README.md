# The Effect of Popularity Bias on Group Recommendation Methods
### by Ladislav Peska and Ladislav Malecek

This repository contains the evaluation source codes as well as additional resources for the paper "The Effect of Popularity Bias on Group Recommendation Methods", which was submitted to Perspectives workshop collocated with RecSys 2021.

This repository is an extension of https://github.com/LadislavMalecek/UMAP2021. Source codes of individual group RS aggregators as well as underlying RS algorithm and codes to generate raw results of decoupled evaluation can be obtained from there. In this repository, we provide the source codes of the coupled and de-biased evaluation protocols. Results folder further contains supplementary figures (comparison of all evaluation scenarios w.r.t. all evaluation metrics) as well as source codes to reproduce the results depicted in the paper.
